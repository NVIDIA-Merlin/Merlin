    "\n",
    "This notebook is created using the latest stable [merlin-tensorflow](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/merlin/containers/merlin-tensorflow) container. This Jupyter notebook example demonstrates how to deploy an `Implicit` model to Triton Inference Server (TIS) and generate prediction results for a given query.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "NVIDIA Merlin is an open source framework that accelerates and scales end-to-end recommender system pipelines. The Merlin framework is broken up into several sub components, these include: Merlin-Core, Merlin-Models, NVTabular and Merlin-Systems. Merlin Systems will be the focus of this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the Merlin Systems library is to make it easy for Merlin users to quickly deploy their recommender systems from development to [Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server). We extended the same user-friendly API users are accustomed to in NVTabular and leverage it to accommodate deploying recommender system components to TIS. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we learn how to deploy an NVTabular Workflow and a trained `Implicit` model from Merlin Models to Triton.\n",
    "- Create Ensemble Graph\n",
    "- Export Ensemble Graph\n",
    "- Run Triton server\n",
    "- Send request to Triton and verify results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the [MovieLens 100k Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/). It consists of ratings a user has given a movie along with some metadata for the user and the movie. We train an Implicit model to predict the rating based on user and item features and proceed to deploy it to the Triton Inference Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the steps taken in this notebook are generalized and can be applied to any set of workflows and models. \n",
