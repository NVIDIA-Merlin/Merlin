Merlin Support Matrix
=====================

The following pages provide the software and model versions that Merlin supports for each container.

Beginning with the 22.06 release, each container can train models and deploy models for inference.
Before the 22.06 release, training and inference were available in separate containers.
To view documentation about the older containers, see the [v0.7.1](https://nvidia-merlin.github.io/Merlin/v0.7.1/support_matrix/index.html) documentation.
