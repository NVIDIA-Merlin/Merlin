Merlin Training
---------------

This container enables you to perform preprocessing and feature engineering with
NVTabular so that you can train a deep learning recommendation model with HugeCTR.

.. include:: generated/nvcr.io-nvidia-merlin-merlin-training.rst


Merlin TensorFlow Training
--------------------------

This container enables you to perform preprocessing and feature engineering with
NVTabular so that you can train a deep learning recommendation model with TensorFlow.

.. include:: generated/nvcr.io-nvidia-merlin-merlin-tensorflow-training.rst


Merlin PyTorch Training
-----------------------

This container enables you to perform preprocessing and feature engineering with
NVTabular so that you can train a deep learning recommendation model with PyTorch.

.. include:: generated/nvcr.io-nvidia-merlin-merlin-pytorch-training.rst


Merlin Inference
----------------

This container enables you to deploy NVTabular workflows and HugeCTR or TensorFlow
models to the Triton Inference Server for production.
