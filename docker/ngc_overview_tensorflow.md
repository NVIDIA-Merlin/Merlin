## What is Merlin for Recommender Systems?

NVIDIA Merlin is a framework for accelerating the entire recommender systems pipeline on the GPU: from data ingestion and training to deployment. Merlin empowers data scientists, machine learning engineers, and researchers to build high-performing recommenders at scale. Merlin includes tools that democratize building deep learning recommenders by addressing common ETL, training, and inference challenges.  Each stage of the Merlin pipeline offers an easy-to-use API and is optimized to support hundreds of terabytes of data.

The Merlin TensorFlow container allows users to do preprocessing and feature engineering with NVTabular, and then train a deep-learning based recommender system model with TensorFlow, and serve the trained model on Triton Inference Server.

## About the Merlin TensorFlow Container

The Merlin Tensorflow container includes the following key components to simplify developing and deploying your recommender system:

* NVTabular performs data preprocessing and feature engineering for tabular data. The library can operate on small and large datasets--scaling to manipulate terabyte-scale datasets that are used to train deep learning recommender systems.

* HugeCTR can train deep learning recommender models and is written in CUDA C++ to provide optimal performance with NVIDIA GPUs. The library is a recommender-specific framework with optimized data loaders that can perform distributed training across multiple GPUs and nodes. HugeCTR provides strategies for scaling large embedding tables beyond available memory.

* Triton Inference Server to provide GPU-accelerated inference. Triton Inference Server simplifies the deployment of AI models at scale in production. The server is an open source inference serving software that enables teams to deploy trained AI models from any framework: TensorFlow, TensorRT, PyTorch, ONNX Runtime, or a custom framework. The server can serve models from local storage or Google Cloud Platform or AWS S3 on any GPU- or CPU-based infrastructure (cloud, data center, or edge). The NVTabular ETL workflow and trained deep learning models (TensorFlow or HugeCTR) can be deployed easily with only a few steps to production.

## Getting Started

### Launch the Merlin TensorFlow Container

You can launch the Merlin TensorFlow container with the following command:

```
docker run --runtime=nvidia --rm -it -p 8888:8888 -p 8797:8787 -p 8796:8786 --ipc=host --cap-add SYS_NICE nvcr.io/nvidia/merlin/merlin-tensorflow:latest /bin/bash
```

If you have a Docker version less than 19.03, change `--gpus all` to `--runtime=nvidia`.

The container will open a shell when the run command completes execution, you will be responsible for starting the jupyter lab on the docker container. Should look similar to below:

Start the jupyter-lab server:

```
cd / ; jupyter-lab --allow-root --ip='0.0.0.0' --NotebookApp.token=''
```

Now you can use any browser to access the jupyter-lab server, via :8888
Once in the server, navigate to the /nvtabular/ directory and explore the code base or try out some of the examples.
Within the container is the codebase, along with all of our dependencies, particularly RAPIDS Dask-cuDF. The easiest way to get started is to simply launch the container above and explore the examples within.
