Recommender Models Guide
=====================

This guide explains the different type of recommender models with a focus on deep-learning based ones.

A recommender model is a single model, either rule-based or trained one, which outputs a score or set of candidates. Generating final recommendations often requires multiple steps, called recommender systems. There is more information on recommender systems in the next guide (will follow soon).
