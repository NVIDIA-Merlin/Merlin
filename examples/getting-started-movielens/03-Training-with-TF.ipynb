    "This notebook is created using the latest stable [merlin-tensorflow-training](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/merlin/containers/merlin-tensorflow-training/tags) container.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will train a Merlin Models model implementing the Deep and Cross Network (DCN) architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merlin Models streamlines the training process and thus despite using a fairly elaborate deep learning architecture, we will only need to write a few lines of code!\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, to accelerate the training, we will leverage the Merlin Dataloader.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [following notebooks](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/models/tree/main/examples) provide a great overview of the concepts in Merlin Models. To learn more about the Merlin Dataloader, please take a look [at its repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/dataloader).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "This notebook explains, how to use the Merlin dataloader to accelerate TensorFlow training.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use **Merlin Dataloader** with TensorFlow Keras model.\n",
    "2. Export the model for performing inference on the Triton Inference Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MovieLens25M\n",
    "\n",
    "The [MovieLens25M](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/) is a popular dataset for recommender systems and is used in academic publications. The dataset contains 25M movie ratings for 62,000 movies given by 162,000 users. Many projects use only the user/item/rating information of MovieLens, but the original dataset provides metadata for the movies, as well. For example, which genres a movie has.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will train a Merlin Models model (Deep Cross Network) to predict the rating a user is likely to give a movie. To ensure we utilize our hardware to the fullest, we will leverage the Merlin Dataloder. It will allow us to load data in a highly optmized way and will ensure that our GPU is utilized to maximum."

The overall model architecture is depicted in Figure below, with two ways to combine the cross network with the deep network: (1) stacked and (2) parallel. The output of the embbedding layer is the concatenation of all the embedded vectors and the normalized dense features: x<sub>0</sub> = [x<sub>embed,1</sub>; . . . ; x<sub>embed,𝑛</sub>; 𝑥<sub>dense</sub>].\n",
