    "Recommender Systems (RecSys) are the engine of the modern internet and the catalyst for human decisions. Building a recommendation system is challenging because it requires multiple stages (data preprocessing, offline training, item retrieval, filtering, ranking, ordering, etc.) to work together seamlessly and efficiently. The biggest challenges for new practitioners are the lack of understanding around what RecSys look like in the real world, and the gap between examples of simple models and a production-ready end-to-end recommender systems."

    "- **Retrieval:** This is the step to narrow down millions of items into thousands of candidates. We are going to train a Two-Tower item retrieval model to retrieve the relevant top-K candidate items.\n",
    "- **Filtering:** This step is to exclude the already interacted  or undesirable items from the candidate items set or to apply business logic rules. Although this is an important step, for this example we skip this step.\n",
    "- **Scoring:** This is also known as ranking. Here the retrieved and filtered candidate items are being scored. We are going to train a ranking model to be able to use at our scoring step. \n",
    "- **Ordering:** At this stage, we can order the final set of items that we want to recommend to the user. Here, we’re able to align the output of the model with business needs, constraints, or criteria.\n",

    "Deep Learning Recommendation Model [(DLRM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00091) architecture is a popular neural network model originally proposed by Facebook in 2019. The model was introduced as a personalization deep learning model that uses embeddings to process sparse features that represent categorical data and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to process dense features, then interacts these features explicitly using the statistical techniques proposed in [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5694074).
